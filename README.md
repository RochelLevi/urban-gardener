# TheUrbanGardener

# Setup

To set this project up, clone it onto your machine. The backend and frontend are both in this repo, so begin by navigating into the backend folder, running bundle install, and rails s to get the server up and running. Then, take note of which port the backend is running on, navigate to the frontend, and edit the first line in 'src/services/index.js' to reflect the port that your backend is running on (default is port 3000). Run npm start, and you should be good to go.


# App Description

The Urban Gardener is a web application to help connect urban homeowners looking to host a garden with others looking for a spot to plant -- community garden style, but on private property. Users can list their property, and those looking for a spot to garden can search listings with the ability to filter by garden type requested, compensation type requested, and distance from an address. Upon finding an interesting listing, users can message the lister and receive responses all on this app.
